## The Problem: GitHub Copilot just deactivated the free trial

If you've been using GitHub Copilot's technical preview, your Copilot probably just deactivated.

Clicking the `Copilot Settings` button leads you to your GitHub account, where you are prompted to start a free 60-day trial.

The long and short of it is that it looks like free use of Copilot is over.

## Can you continue to use Copilot for free?

There are some [indications](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2021/09/24/github-copilot-alternatives.aspx) that you can have free access to Copilot for open-source projects, but the details are not immediately obvious on the Copilot [website]().

You might as well try the free trial and get prepared to pay for your usage, or else you can take a look at an open-source alternative like [gpt-code-clippy](https://github.com/CodedotAl/gpt-code-clippy/wiki).

Here's a link to the [free VS Code extension](https://github.com/CodedotAl/code-clippy-vscode), but it doesn't look like it's been in active development for about 6 months.
